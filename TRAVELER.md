We are Valentinas and his wife — explorers of balance.
In traveling we love balance" experiance vs comfort, city vs nature. if we can fit both of these, the trip is perfect.
Common trip time 10 days.
We love active journeys: discovering, driving, walking, observing, yet always keeping time for short resets — half-day rest, half-day adventure.
Whole days by the sea bore us, but a half day near water, half day exploring feels perfect.
We prefer pools over seas, yet we crave beautiful views, nature, forests, and animals.
We are drawn to unique experiences — mountain roads, scenic hikes, rooftop dinners, infinity pools, quiet villages, and unexpected corners of cities.
We travel by car, ideally under 3 hours of driving per day, enjoying the road but not wasting days on it.
We seek a rhythm: move, rest, feel, repeat.
Common way to get to the place - flights. 

Based on trip duration, our plans could be different:
1-3 days - mostly single city
3-7 days - probably rent a car can visit something around
7+ days - definetly plan based on options here, maybe even join multiple coutries or drive the whole country by rented car

Our goal is simple — to design trips that make us feel alive, rested, and connected, not just “busy.”
Every destination must serve one of three purposes:
- Energize us (nature, activity, immersion)
- Calm us (rest, views, water, sunsets)
- Inspire us (architecture, city vibe, culture)
