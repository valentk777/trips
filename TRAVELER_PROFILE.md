# Valentinas' Traveler Profile & Prompt Guide

This document outlines the travel preferences and planning styles of Valentinas. Use this as a guide for all future trip planning requests.

## Core Preferences (Applicable to all trips)
*   **Travelers:** All trips are planned for two people (Valentinas and his wife).
*   **Interests:** A blend of iconic "top list" attractions and "trendy/youthful" spots (e.g., ruin bars, street art, unique cafes, local design shops).
*   **Food:** Food is a key part of the experience. The plan should include a mix of local street food and highly-rated, atmospheric restaurants.
*   **Museums:** Open to museums, especially those that are unique and interactive (like the Pinball Museum) or historically significant (like the House of Terror). Standard art galleries are a lower priority.
*   **Practical Info:** For all suggested attractions, the plan must include key practical details:
    *   Working hours.
    *   Ticket prices (in local currency with an approximate EUR equivalent).
    *   Student discount availability.
    *   Advance booking requirements (and links if possible).

## Style 1: Long & Detailed Trips (1-2+ weeks, e.g., Costa Rica, Thailand)
*   **Structure:** Create a highly detailed, day-by-day itinerary.
*   **Formatting:** Use the specific Lithuanian format: `X d. (YYYY-MM-DD Lithuanian_Weekday_Name)`.
*   **Logistics:** Include all logistical details:
    *   Flight numbers and times.
    *   Accommodation details with addresses and booking links.
    *   Car rental information (company, dates, type).
    *   Information on all transfers (ferries, domestic flights, trains, etc.).
*   **Activities:** Plan a packed schedule with a mix of:
    *   **Nature & Adventure:** Hiking in national parks, seeing volcanoes, waterfalls, wildlife viewing, ziplining, hanging bridges.
    *   **Culture:** Visiting temples, historical sites, and city exploration.
    *   **Relaxation:** Include dedicated multi-day blocks for beach or island time if the destination allows.
*   **Pacing:** Generally fast-paced with early starts, but with scheduled multi-day periods for downtime and relaxation.

## Style 2: Short & Flexible Trips (Weekend/City Breaks, e.g., Riga, Milan, Budapest)
*   **Structure:** Do not create a strict, timed itinerary. The plan should be a concise, bullet-pointed list of recommendations.
*   **Formatting:** Group recommendations by category (e.g., Sights, Food, Bars, Museums, Trendy Spots). Use minimal, direct language.
*   **Logistics:** Include flight times and the main accommodation address. No need for detailed transfer plans beyond airport-to-city advice.
*   **Activities:** Focus on a single city's highlights:
    *   Key architectural and historical sights.
    *   Trendy neighborhoods for walking, shopping, and discovering street art.
    *   A curated list of top-rated and unique cafes, bars, and restaurants.
*   **Pacing:** Relaxed and exploratory. The plan should be a list of high-quality suggestions that can be picked and chosen from on the go.
